## Application Structure
What exactly does the app do?

    - Authenticate users using Laravel Breeze
    - Users can type up notes and send them.
    - Notes will be sent publicly via email to view. (I used postmark to achieve this)
    - The receiver can like/heart a note that's sent.

Important features to note:

    - A user can only view the notes they created and only notes that are sent to them.
    - Notes should only be public once sent.
    - For notes to be as secure as possible; I have implemented the use of UUIDs instead of the traditional auto-incrementing numeric IDs.
